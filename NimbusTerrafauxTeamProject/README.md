**WPF advantages**

It's newer and thereby more in tune with current standards
Microsoft is using it for a lot of new applications, e.g. Visual Studio
It's more flexible, so you can do more things without having to write or buy new controls
When you do need to use 3rd party controls, the developers of these controls will likely be more focused on WPF because it's newer
XAML makes it easy to create and edit your GUI, and allows the work to be split between a designer (XAML) and a programmer (C#, VB.NET etc.)
Databinding, which allows you to get a more clean separation of data and layout
Uses hardware acceleration for drawing the GUI, for better performance
It allows you to make user interfaces for both Windows applications and web applications (Silverlight/XBAP)
